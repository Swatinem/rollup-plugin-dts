### Checklist

* [ ] I can reproduce this issue when running this plugin on its own.
  *Other plugins, such as `node-resolve` are known to cause issues.*
* [ ] I am running this plugin on `.d.ts` files generated by TypeScript.
  *The plugin can consume `.ts` and even `.js` files (with `allowJs: true`), but this is known to cause issues.*
* [ ] This issue is not related to rolling up `@types`.
  *The plugin ignores these by default, unless `respectExternal` is set. `@types` can contain hand-crafted code which is known to cause issues.*

### Code Snippet

```ts
// Your code that is causing problems.
```

### Error Message
